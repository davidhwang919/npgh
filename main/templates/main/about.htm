                We are an organization dedicated combating hunger in our local area through community engagement.  We realize that several families are struggling  during the COVID-19 pandemic, and want to do everything we can to make sure that the people in and around our  area don't go hungry.
            </p>
            <p style="background-color:rgb(95, 201, 243);font-size:15pt;">
                We were founded because we realized that so many people around us were losing their jobs and we wanted to give back to our community. We understand that this is a difficult time for so many. 
                In order to fulfill our purpose, we host food drives and fundraisers. We partner up with local food banks to help distribute food to people who are in need. All while prioritizing safety and following guidelines during the pandemic. Along with our projects, we work to raise awareness about the issue of hunger in our community, events, and media. We also raise awareness about hunger and inform our local community about these issues and what we can do to help.
